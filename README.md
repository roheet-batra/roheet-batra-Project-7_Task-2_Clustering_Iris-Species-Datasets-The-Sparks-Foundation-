- Iris is a flowering plant, the researchers have measured various features of the different iris flowers and recorded digitally.  
- The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species. In short, It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower.  
- The dataset contains five columns such as Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width and Species Type.  
- Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.   

## <font color = Green > Task Objective </font>  

One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other. We need to identify and create the number of clusters w.r.t. the Sepal and Petal features and visually identify which species belong to which class according to their linearity. 

## <font color = Green > Steps Followed </font>

The steps are broadly:
1. Read and understand the data
2. EDA
3. Prepare the data for modelling
4. K-Means Modelling
